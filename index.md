## Welcome to Vivyan's World of Wonders!

I am an astrophysicist and observe the night sky for a living. Among all the wonders created by the universe, I am most interested in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), a facinating population of active massive blackholes. They give us clues about the evolution of blackholes as well as their host galaxies. 

I am currently working as a postdoc at Penn State, studying AGNs with large X-ray surveys ([XMM-SERVE](https://personal.psu.edu/wnb3/xmmservs/xmmservs.html)). Before coming to Penn State, I got my PhD in Physics & Astronomy at Dartmouth College and my B.S. degree from School of the Gifted Young at University of Science and Technology of China. I love music, movies, writing and classical literature. I also spend most weekends on outdoor activities as well, such as hiking, biking and horse-back riding.
