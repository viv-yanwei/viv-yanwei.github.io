# Welcome to Vivyan's World of Wonders!

I am an astrophysicist and observe the night sky for a living. Among all the wonders created by the universe, I am most interested in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs), a facinating population of active massive blackholes. They give us clues about the evolution of blackholes as well as their host galaxies. 

I am currently working as a postdoc at Penn State, studying AGNs with large X-ray surveys ([XMM-SERVE](https://personal.psu.edu/wnb3/xmmservs/xmmservs.html)). Before coming to Penn State, I got my PhD in Physics & Astronomy at Dartmouth College and my B.S. degree from School of the Gifted Young at University of Science and Technology of China. I love music, movies, writing and classical literature. I also spend most weekends on outdoor activities as well, such as hiking, biking and horse-back riding.

# Astronomy Research

### 1. Characterize AGNs with X-ray specral analysis and SED fits in large X-ray surveys

I obtained X-ray spectra of ~10,200 sources in three catalog (WCDFS, ELAIS1, LSS) and conduct systematic spectral analysis with comprehensive “torus” model and implement different statistical approaches (Bayesian) to precisely estimate AGN characteristics (e.g., NH, photon index, covering factor). I select AGN samples with different characteristics for future follow-up observations and compare the samples with galactic features obtained from the SED fits (e.g., star-forming rate, stellar mass) by XCIGAL, to obtain the representative to quantitatively discuss the co-evolution between AGNs and their host galaxies.


### 2. Connect supermassive blackholes to their hosts with [Chandra](https://chandra.harvard.edu/20th/) catalogs (CDWFS & CDFS 7Ms)


We characterize AGN X-ray obscuration with AGN properties and host galactic activity like star forming in multiple bands. By extracting and stacking spectra of sources in the CDFS 7Ms catalog, this large sample of AGNs give us a clue on the origin of the obscuration.

### 3. Uncover hidden monsters with [NuSTAR](https://www.nustar.caltech.edu/) and optical observations ([Keck](https://www.keckobservatory.org/) and [SALT](https://www.salt.ac.za/))



Four heavily obscured quasars are observed using NuSTAR and Keck. They were selected from a large population of obscured quasars, based on mid-IR photometry from WISE and SDSS. We found heavy high obscuration in X-ray images, and also unexpected large absorption in the host galactic environment.


### 4. The two-dimensional properties of [M51](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whirlpool_Galaxy)


I studied the relationship of star formation rate, dust extinction, metallicity with internal galaxy dynamics. Some recent works suggest there is inconsistency with these measurements in different regions of M51. By analyzing spectra at different regions of the face-on galaxy. I studied how different physical mechanisms could explain such observational discrepancies.


### 5. Seeing analysis of [Chinese Antarctic Research Station]()

During my internship at the Polar Research Institute of China, I built measured equipment based on electric bridge to avoid exposing the whole equipment in cold weather. Estimated the location for Chinese future [Antarctic Research Station Kunlun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunlun_Station_(Antarctica)) and its potential future value.
